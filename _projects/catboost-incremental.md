CatBoost Incremental enables **distributed training and serving of CatBoost models** on datasets too large for memory using Ray's distributed computing framework.

## What It Does

Solves the challenge of training gradient boosting models on massive datasets that exceed memory limits. Combines CatBoost's categorical feature handling with Ray's distributed processing for scalable machine learning.

## Key Capabilities

- **Incremental Training**: Process datasets chunk-by-chunk without loading everything into memory
- **Distributed Processing**: Leverage Ray's distributed computing for hyperparameter tuning and training
- **Cloud-Native**: Direct integration with S3 and other cloud storage systems
- **Production Serving**: Deploy trained models with Ray Serve for scalable inference

## Best Used For

- **Big Data ML**: Training on datasets that don't fit in memory (S3 parquet files, TB+ datasets)
- **Distributed Hyperparameter Tuning**: Running Ray Tune experiments across cluster resources
- **Production ML Systems**: Scalable model serving with automatic load balancing
- **Cloud ML Pipelines**: End-to-end workflows from cloud storage to production deployment
- **Resource-Constrained Training**: Maximizing model quality when compute resources are limited

*Essential for data scientists working with massive datasets who need both scalability and CatBoost's categorical feature advantages.*
