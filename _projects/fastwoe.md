FastWoe provides efficient **Weight of Evidence (WOE)** encoding with statistical inference for interpretable machine learning in regulated industries.

## What It Does

Transforms categorical features into continuous, interpretable scores that measure the relationship strength between categories and target labels. Essential for credit scoring where model transparency is required by regulators.

## Key Capabilities

- **Statistical Rigor**: First library to provide confidence intervals and significance testing for WOE values
- **Production Ready**: Scikit-learn compatible with optimized performance for large datasets
- **Intelligent Processing**: Handles high-cardinality features and missing values automatically
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets interpretability requirements for financial modeling

## Best Used For

- **Credit Scoring & Risk Management**: Traditional scorecard development with statistical validation
- **Regulated Industries**: Healthcare, finance, insurance where model explainability is mandatory  
- **Model Validation**: Statistical significance testing before feature deployment
- **Compliance Reporting**: Transparent models with confidence intervals for audit trails

*Built for data scientists who need both predictive power and regulatory compliance.*
