WoeBoost combines **gradient boosting power with Weight of Evidence interpretability** for high-stakes domains requiring both accuracy and explainability.

## What It Does

Bridges the gap between black-box gradient boosting performance and the interpretability required in regulated industries. Every prediction is backed by accumulated evidence that stakeholders can understand and validate.

## Key Capabilities

- **Evidence-Based Boosting**: Each iteration accumulates interpretable Weight of Evidence rather than abstract residuals
- **Automatic Monotonicity**: Infers and enforces logical relationships between features and outcomes
- **Calibrated Scoring**: Produces well-calibrated probabilities essential for regulated decision-making
- **Free-Threaded Performance**: 3.67Ã— speedup with Python 3.14+ free-threading (experimental)

## Best Used For

- **Credit Risk Modeling**: Interpretable scoring systems that regulators can validate and approve
- **Healthcare Risk Assessment**: Transparent models where life-critical decisions require explainable evidence
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meeting strict interpretability requirements while maintaining predictive power
- **High-Stakes Decision Making**: Any domain where "black box" models are unacceptable
- **Audit-Ready Models**: Systems that can demonstrate exactly how each decision was reached

*Perfect for data scientists who refuse to sacrifice interpretability for performance in regulated environments.*
