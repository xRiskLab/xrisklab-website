RF-Explainer provides **post-hoc explainability** for Random Forest models through advanced tree traversal and ensemble analysis.

## What It Does

Makes Random Forest "black box" models transparent by revealing how individual trees make decisions and contribute to final predictions. Essential when you need to understand and justify model behavior.

## Key Capabilities  

- **Tree-Level Insights**: Examine decision paths through individual trees in the ensemble
- **Credit Scoring Integration**: Convert Random Forest predictions into interpretable credit scores with PDO scaling
- **Feature Path Analysis**: Trace exactly how features influence predictions through decision nodes
- **Visual Explanations**: Interactive and static visualizations of tree structures and decision paths

## Best Used For

- **Model Auditing**: Understanding how Random Forest models make decisions for compliance
- **Credit Risk Models**: Converting ensemble predictions into traditional scorecard formats
- **Debugging**: Identifying why certain predictions seem incorrect or unexpected  
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Explaining complex ensemble predictions to non-technical audiences
- **Regulated Industries**: Meeting explainability requirements in finance and risk management

*Perfect for data scientists who need to open the Random Forest "black box" for audit, debugging, or regulatory compliance.*
